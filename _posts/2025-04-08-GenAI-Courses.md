## Notes from the course <a name="paragraph1"></a>
- **Be concise with prompts**
  - bad : prompt = "What do you think could be a good name for a flower shop that specializes in selling bouquets of dried flowers more than fresh flowers?"
  - good : prompt = "Suggest a name for a flower shop that sells bouquets of dried flowers"
- **Be specific and well-defined**
  - Bad : The prompt below might be a bit too generic (which is certainly OK if you'd like to ask a generic question!)
  - Good:  "Generate a list of ways that makes Earth unique compared to other planets"
-  **Ask for one task at a time**
   - Bad: "What's the best method of boiling water and why is the sky blue?"
   - Good  "What's the best method of boiling water?"
- **Watch out for hallucinations**: Although LLMs have been trained on a large amount of data, they can generate text containing statements not grounded in truth or reality; these responses from the LLM are often referred to as "hallucinations" due to their limited memorization capabilities. Note that simply prompting the LLM to provide a citation isn't a fix to this problem, as there are instances of LLMs providing false or inaccurate citations. Dealing with hallucinations is a fundamental challenge of LLMs and an ongoing research area, so it is important to be cognizant that LLMs may seem to give you confident, correct-sounding statements that are in fact incorrect.
- **How can we attempt to reduce the chances of irrelevant responses and hallucinations**?One way is to provide the LLM with system instructions.
- **Generative tasks lead to higher output variability**
    - The prompt below results in an open-ended response, useful for brainstorming, but response is highly variable.
    - prompt = "I'm a high school student. Recommend me a programming activity to improve my skills."
â€‹- **Classification tasks reduces output variability**
    - The prompt below results in a choice and may be useful if you want the output to be easier to control.
    - prompt = """I'm a high school student. Which of these activities do you suggest and why:
        a) learn Python
        b) learn JavaScript
        c) learn Fortran
    """
