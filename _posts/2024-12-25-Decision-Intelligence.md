## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
- Two things determine the quality of your life: luck and the quality of your decisions. You can control only one of them
- Good decision-making compounds over time
- Decision skills are the steering wheels of your life
- Decision intelligence is turning information into **better action** at any scale, under any setting
- **Decision-making is a skill you can get better at**


## Decision Maker In Isolation <a name="paragraph1"></a>
This section goes over - the differences between a decision and an outcome, outcome bias, and its pitfalls

### Decisions vs Outcome <a name="decvout"></a>
- **Decision** is more than a choice between options. It is an **irrevocable allocation of resources**. Money, time, opportunity cost
- **Outcome** is how things turn out later. A good decision might or might not lead to a good outcome.
- If you show an "outcome bias," i.e., sometimes good decisions lead to bad outcomes, you will walk away learning the wrong lessons.
- Outcome has two components, the quality of decision and luck. Please keep in mind the conditions under which a decision was made.


### Dangers of outcome bias <a name="outbias"></a>
- Always evaluate decisions based on what was known at the time the decision was made.
- Dont judge decision makers by what was not known at the time a decision was made
- Writing down the things known at the time of a decision is critical to learn the right lessons from the decisions. 
  - Do this immediately after the decision is made. Saves for from hindsight bias
- Key ways to evaluate a decision quality -
  - which factors did the decision maker consider?
  - how did they gather information?
  - which sources did they use?
  - did they get the right amount of information based on what was at stake?
- Key lesson - for important decisions document the decision-making process     

### Difficult Decisions <a name="difdec"></a>
- what makes certain decisions harder than others?
    - Options: Large number of options and particularly combinations of options
    - Similarity between options: No clear winner among options
    - No clear objectives: Have you considered how a decision is being made? Criteria?
    - High Cost: Evaluation and execution cost. How expensive are the mistakes?
    - Reversibility: Is it possible to reverse a decision that goes against the definition of a decision above
    - Cognitive Load: high cognitive function. A lot of effort.
    - Emotion: Does the decision trigger you emotionally?
    - Information: Do you have full and reliable information?
    - Risk & Ambiguity: Both make a decision much harder
      - Ambiguity - Probability not known. Risk - probability is known
    - Timing: Amount of time you have to make a decision
    - Group decisions: where the decision has a large impact on others
    - Social consequences & social effects: scrutiny and consequences
    - Internal conflicts: Conflict of incentives
    - Adversial effects: competition
- when a decision seems complex, pause, slow down and re-evaluate
