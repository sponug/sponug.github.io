## Motivation <a name="introduction"></a>
Latency is simply the "delay" or time it takes for information to travel from one point to another on a network. How long you have to wait for a response after taking an action online is measured in milliseconds; low latency means a quick response, while high latency means a noticeable delay. [Grace Hooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2723&v=ZR0ujwlvbkQ&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fdataphys.org%2F&source_ve_path=NzY3NTg) used wires to visualize very short durations of time in computing. If you need further motivation, please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eqqCwhPlyU&t=538s&ab_channel=CHjortInvest) on latency arbitrage. For example - a stock is essentially Stock X is trading at $100 on Exchange A but $100.05 on Exchange B.
A firm detects the lag, buys on A, and sells on B within milliseconds, pocketing a small profit. So latency surely is a big deal!

Ok..so now that is out of the way, let's try to learn more about latency using various sources
