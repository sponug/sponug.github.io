title: On Stakeholder Management
---

- Projects exist within a complex ecosystem of stakeholders and other projects managers managing projects which are related to you in some way 
- Having a simple and concise way of analysing the ecosystem is a vital part of project management
- You need to be able to build a very open and transparent relationship with your stakeholders 
- There are various types of models to identify and analyse stakeholders - affinity diagrams , RACI being two of them. But we will consider a simpler model here
- We will categorize stakeholders into **3 categories** -
  - **Critical** : can stop project from succeding . Have to buy-in and sign-off on any critical decision within the project. Build and mantain relationship/communicate F2F
  - **essential**: can delay the project.You can find replacements but can delay you. Two-way communication
  - **interested**: Must be informed. As long as they are aware of what is happening , they will remain passive. One-way updates
- Consult and pre-consult your critical stakeholders.Ensure interested parties are communicated with
- Take the whole lifecycle model when engaging with your stakeholders. Interested in Dev obvious but who operate and realise the benefits are important as well.
- Typically during execution ( critical, essential and interested) during support( critical , essential ) and during benefit realisation( informed )
- Understanding the **relationship/dependencies** among projects is critical. There are **6 types**:
  - Data : You are creating data they need or they are creating they need.
  - Function/Business process: You are creating a function that the other project needs or vice versa
  - Org impact : you are planning release at the same time as other project overloading the stakeholder community.
  - Funding relationship : if they dont deliver their benefits you dont get your costing
  - Technology: the other project has to build and deploy a piece of technology that you are dependent on
  - Shared resource: sharing a critical team member with another project manager. 
- One way to better understand why your stakeholders behave in a certain way is a **win/lose** model
  - Ask yourself , if you are successfully deliver a project , what are the wins for a particular stakeholder and what are their losses for each win?
  - Builds open and trusting relationship with the stakeholders . Best time to use this tool is upfront , before you start the project
