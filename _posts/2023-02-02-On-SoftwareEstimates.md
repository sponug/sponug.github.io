Notes on getting better at software estimates: Notes from Chapter 7 of [The Effective Engineer](https://www.amazon.com.au/Effective-Engineer-Engineering-Disproportionate-Meaningful/dp/0996128107) 

**I found the book to be pragmatic and would recommend it to both Junior as well as Senior Engineers**

> What is a good estimate?
   >>  A good estimate, is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project reality to allow the project leadership to make good decisions about how to control the project to hit its targets . 
   >>>  Steve McConnell, Software Estimation   

Key topics covered are :
- Decomposing project estimates to increase accuracy 
- Get better at budgeting for unknown 
- Clearly define project scope and establish measurable milestones 
- Reduce risk as early as possible 
- Not sprinting in the middle of a marathon
