## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
- Two things determine the quality of your life: luck and the quality of your decisions. You can control only one of them
- Good decision-making compounds over time
- Decision skills are the steering wheels of your life
- Decision intelligence is turning information into **better action** at any scale, under any setting
- **Decision-making is a skill you can get better at**


## Decision Maker In Isolation <a name="paragraph1"></a>
This section goes over - the differences between a decision and an outcome, outcome bias, and its pitfalls

### Decisions vs Outcome <a name="decvout"></a>
- **Decision** is more than a choice between options. It is an **irrevocable allocation of resources**. Money, time, opportunity cost
- **Outcome** is how things turn out later. A good decision might or might not lead to a good outcome.
- If you show an "outcome bias," i.e., sometimes good decisions lead to bad outcomes, you will walk away learning the wrong lessons.
- Outcome has two components, the quality of decision and luck. Please keep in mind the conditions under which a decision was made.


### Dangers of outcome bias <a name="outbias"></a>
- Always evaluate decisions based on what was known at the time the decision was made.
- Dont judge decision makers by what was not known at the time a decision was made
- Writing down the things known at the time of a decision is critical to learn the right lessons from the decisions. 
  - Do this immediately after the decision is made. Saves for from hindsight bias
- Key ways to evaluate a decision quality -
  - which factors did the decision maker consider?
  - how did they gather information?
  - which sources did they use?
  - did they get the right amount of information based on what was at stake?
- Key lesson - for important decisions document the decision-making process     

### Difficult Decisions <a name="difdec"></a>
- what makes certain decisions harder than others?
    - Options: Large number of options and particularly combinations of options
    - Similarity between options: No clear winner among options
    - No clear objectives: Have you considered how a decision is being made? Criteria?
    - High Cost: Evaluation and execution cost. How expensive are the mistakes?
    - Reversibility: Is it possible to reverse a decision that goes against the definition of a decision above
    - Cognitive Load: high cognitive function. A lot of effort.
    - Emotion: Does the decision trigger you emotionally?
    - Information: Do you have full and reliable information?
    - Risk & Ambiguity: Both make a decision much harder
      - Ambiguity - Probability not known. Risk - probability is known
    - Timing: Amount of time you have to make a decision
    - Group decisions: where the decision has a large impact on others
    - Social consequences & social effects: scrutiny and consequences
    - Internal conflicts: Conflict of incentives
    - Adversial effects: competition
- when a decision seems complex, pause, slow down and re-evaluate

### How to set Goals <a name="goals"></a>
- Before setting goals, think about the priorities and opportunities
- when thinking about priorities,
    - Start by thinking of non-priorities
    - Some of these might be other people's priorities, but not yours
- Next start thinking about your opportunities
- Two classic mistakes while setting goals are - being too concrete & being too vague
- The trick is to have layers of goals that serve different purposes for you. Three kinds of goals -
    - Outcome Goals: The win that you are interested in. It might be hard to measure and hence vague. Ex: Be more healthy
    - Performance Goal: Measurable and under your control. Can be aspirational. Ex: run 5 miles in under 45 mins
    - Process Goal: Measurable and fully under your control.Ex: Run 45mins every other day
- **Never allow the process goal to take over the most important**

### Intuition <a name="intuition"></a>
- How much effort, data & information to put towards your decision
The key is not to overspend or underspend on a decision
- Visualize the best and worst-case scenarios of what could come out of  your decision
- what are you willing to pay for the perfect decision? When the value isn't too high - use intuition
- Intuition works best for low-value decisions.
- Practice using rigor to make low-value decisions.
- Intuition also works best under time pressure. Expertise helps here
- Unstructured decision making
- use the most amount of time on decisions which are  -
  - High importance
  - Plenty of time
  - Lack expertise
  - needs structure 

### Human Elements In Decision Making <a name="human"></a>
- Humans are influenced by biological factors: Our decision-making can be suboptimal due to factors like lack of sleep, low blood sugar, stress, and strong emotions.
- Pre-hacking yourself: Like athletes create optimal conditions for performance, you should create optimal conditions for important decisions. Avoid making critical decisions when you're not at your best.
- Principal-agent problem analogy: Long-term goals (principal) and short-term desires (agent) can conflict. Setting constraints can help align short-term actions with long-term goals.
- These points highlight the importance of understanding and managing the biological and psychological factors that affect our decision-making

### Being Decisive <a name="decisive"></a>
- Timing of Decisions: Make decisions at the right time to avoid wasting resources. 
- Prioritization: Indecisiveness often stems from being distracted by lower-priority decisions. Focus on high-priority decisions to avoid cognitive overload.
- Handling Emotions: When all options seem bad, choose the least worst one and execute it. Avoid getting stuck in emotional grief over suboptimal choices.
- Similar Options: If options are very similar in value, don't over-optimize. Save your energy for more significant decisions.

### Objectivity <a name="objectivity"></a>
- Confirmation Bias: This is a psychological effect where your pre-existing beliefs influence how you perceive and interpret information, making it difficult to remain objective.
- Impact of Cognitive Biases: Your brain can play tricks on you, affecting how you process information. Even the wording of information can change your decisions.
- Data and Objectivity: Data does not automatically equal objectivity. It's important to be aware of your cognitive biases and how they might affect your interpretation of data.

## Decision Intelligence <a name="intel"></a>
- Data as a Tool: Data is a powerful tool for decision-making, but it's important to remember that data itself is just a means to an end.
- Electronic Storage: Storing information electronically enhances memory and accessibility, making it easier to analyze and use.
- **Limitations of Data**: Data is not inherently objective or true; it is influenced by the choices and biases of the people who collect and interpret it.
- The value of data is memory, not objectivity

### Better Questions <a name="questions"></a>
- Analytics is taking a look at information and enables us to frame the questions
    - what are the options
    - what assumptions are reasonable    - 
    - what what questions are relevant and which ones are worth asking
- Analytics augment the decision makers' abilities but is not decision-making by itself
- Managing analytics is investing time in exploration

### Data Driven Decisions <a name="ddd"></a>
- When using data for decisions watch out for confirmation bias i.e. when you are looking for data to back the decision you already made
- Avoiding Confirmation Bias: To make a truly data-driven decision, it's crucial to set your goals and criteria before looking at the data to avoid confirmation bias.
- Separate Data Sets: Use separate data sets for analytics and statistics to ensure that your questions and answers are not influenced by the same data points.
- Pre-Decision Homework: Decision-makers should do their homework and define what the data means to them before analyzing it to improve decision quality.

### Better Answers <a name="bans"></a>
- Steps to frame a data-driven decision
- what would you do with no new information? We are selecting the default action
- Does the information truly change my mind
- what would do with all the information you needed?
- Stats is helpful when you don't have all the information and there is uncertainty
- Deal with information in this order -
    - No information. This leads to the default action
    - Full information. Which pieces of information would you consider
    - Partial information. Stats can help here     

### Decision Automation <a name="auto"></a>
- Data science is an umbrella term used to make data useful and involves 4 different flavors depending on the number of decisions 
    - analytics: no idea. Open minded and exploring
    - Stats: used for a few important decisions
    - Machine Learning / AI - Many decisions
    - Persuasion: Data storytelling. 
- Decision Automation: Machine learning and AI are essential for automating decisions at a large scale, using patterns in data to create models that execute decisions automatically.
- Machine learning boils down to **optimise ___(objective) on __( Examples )**  

## Data Driven Leadership <a name="ddl"></a>

### Group Decisions <a name="grp"></a>
- Shared Decision Responsibility: It's important to identify who the true decision makers are and how decision responsibility is shared within the group.
- Benefits of Group Decisions: Group decisions can balance out individual biases and align more closely with the organization's vision by incorporating diverse perspectives.
- Challenges of Group Decisions: Effective group decision-making requires higher skill levels, can take more time, and may be influenced by factors like charisma and status. It's crucial to design processes that maintain independence and clearly assign responsibilities
