This section goes over - the differences between a decision and an outcome, outcome bias, and its pitfalls

### Decisions vs Outcome <a name="decvout"></a>
- **Decision** is more than a choice between options. It is an **irrevocable allocation of resources**. Money, time, opportunity cost
- **Outcome** is how things turn out later. A good decision might or might not lead to a good outcome.
- If you show an "outcome bias" i.e. sometimes good decisions leading to bad outcomes , you walkaway learning the wrong lessons.
- Outcome has two omponents , the quality of decision and luck . Be aware of the conditions under which a decision was made.

  - Do this immediately after the decision is made. Saves for from hinsight bias
